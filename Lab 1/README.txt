Lab #1


Part 1:
The code is straightforward and working as outlined in the lab.


Part 2:
The program is also functional. However, there might be one thing that's unclear. I XORed the input string against a string of all 1's to invert the binary representation.


Part 1: C program that reads two positive integers from the user and prints 
1) Average of the two numbers
2) Whether each number is a prime number or not
3) Whether the numbers are relatively prime

Part 2: Converts a signed decimal integer into binary. Prints it in:
1)Signed dec
2)Unsigned dec
3)Hex
4)Binary
